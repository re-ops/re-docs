# Operating

In this section we will cover the basic workflows when using Re-mote and Re-code, you will find that there is a clear convention to both of them and the follow similar guidelines:

* Use simple functions and protocols where possible (this is also nice for REPL auto completion)
* Create one REPL instance for Re-mote and one for Re-core.
* Use the reloaded workflow when making changes.
